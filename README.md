### **Queue Management System**  
 
This application models a **multi-queue management system**, utilizing **multithreading** and **synchronization** to efficiently distribute clients across queues. It ensures safe concurrent execution with synchronized data structures and provides real-time event logging.  

#### **Key Features**  
✔ **Multithreading** – Dedicated threads for each queue to enable parallel processing  
✔ **Thread Synchronization** – Maintains data integrity during concurrent operations  
✔ **Dynamic Client Allocation** – Implements strategies like shortest queue and shortest processing time (**Strategy Pattern**)  
✔ **Randomized Client Generation** – Simulates unpredictable customer arrivals  
✔ **Intuitive Graphical Interface** – Configure simulation parameters and observe queue behavior  
✔ **Performance Analysis** – Calculates average waiting time, service time, and peak-hour statistics  
✔ **Event Logging** – Stores simulation data in a `.txt` file for review
